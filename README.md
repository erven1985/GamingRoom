# The Gaming Room Project

## Project Overview

The Gaming Room client is a small game development company looking to expand their operations by transitioning their existing game, **Draw It or Lose It**, to a scalable and platform-independent solution. They required a software design that would allow multiple users to play the game seamlessly across web and mobile platforms while ensuring security, scalability, and maintainability.

## Summary of Work

### Client
The client, **The Gaming Room**, specializes in developing and hosting multiplayer games.

### Software Requirements
The client wanted to transition their game to a cloud-based architecture that:
- Supports scalability for an increasing user base.
- Provides cross-platform compatibility (web and mobile).
- Ensures efficient resource management and secure user authentication.

### Documentation Highlights
- **System Requirements:** Detailed analysis of functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Architecture Design:** Created a scalable, cloud-based architecture using microservices.
- **Technology Recommendations:** Suggested tools like AWS for hosting, Firebase for authentication, and React for the front-end.
- **Development Roadmap:** Outlined clear milestones for the project.

## Key Achievements

### Strengths in Documentation
- Clear and organized presentation of client requirements.
- Comprehensive comparison of architectural solutions.
- Concise yet detailed design decisions, allowing stakeholders to easily understand the rationale behind recommendations.

### Benefits of the Process
- Working through the design document helped streamline coding by providing a clear blueprint.
- Identified potential challenges (e.g., security and scaling issues) early in the process.
- The iterative approach allowed for client feedback and adjustments before development.

## Areas for Improvement

If I could revise one part of the documentation, it would be the **testing plan**. While functional and integration tests were covered, I would expand it to include more robust user acceptance and performance testing plans. This would ensure the system’s reliability under heavy load.

## User-Centered Design

### Interpreting User Needs
Understanding the user’s need for a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience led to design choices such as:
- Minimal latency in multiplayer interactions.
- A responsive UI that adapts to different devices.
- Secure login and account management.

### Importance of User Needs
Considering user needs ensures the software is intuitive, reliable, and enjoyable, directly impacting user satisfaction and client success.

## Design Approach and Future Strategies

### Approach
- **Requirement Analysis:** Collaborated with the client to define clear and measurable objectives.
- **System Design:** Created diagrams (e.g., UML) to visualize architecture and workflows.
- **Iterative Development:** Incorporated feedback through regular reviews.

### Future Strategies
- Adopt **Agile methodologies** for continuous feedback and iteration.
- Use tools like **JIRA** for better task management.
- Conduct in-depth **user journey mapping** to refine user-centered designs.
